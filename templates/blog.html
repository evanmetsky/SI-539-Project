                            </div>
                            <p>Breakfast is my favorite meal to cook and prepare myself, and I most enjoy making omelettes and pancakes. My favorite breakfast dish is eggs benedict, but usually when I eat breakfast I have coffee, fruit, oatmeal, or a bagel.</p>
                            <p>I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pa, which is a city that is known for its sports teams and its restaurants. Pittsburgh is home to a few famous diners including DeLuca’s, which has been in Pittsburgh’s historic Strip District since 1950, and Pamela’s. Pamela’s Diner was briefly in the national spotlight in 2008 because, during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, Barack and Michelle Obama visited a Pamela’s location for breakfast. In May 2009, Mrs. Obama invited Pamela’s co-owners, Gail Klingensmith and Pamela Cohen, to cook breakfast at the White House. </p>
                            <p>Although Pamela’s is one of the most famous diners in Pittsburgh, my favorite places to have breakfast are Zenith and Enrico’s. Zenith is an antique store, but on Sunday it is transformed into a brunch buffet! Brunch-goers are surrounded by vintage clothing and old-timey paintings as they navigate the buffet of vegan salads and cakes. Enrico’s is a small Italian bistro and bakery in Pittsburgh’s famous Strip District that serves breakfast only on Saturdays. I really like their fresh bread, coffee, and “greens and beans” dish.</p>
                            <p>Pittsburgh is a great city that has great food, and options for breakfast food are especially fantastic!</p>

                            <p>Breakfast for me is my energy for the day.  As an international student from China who has been in the states for 5 years, I love both Chinese breakfast and breakfast in the U.S. </p>
                            <p>My favorite U.S. style breakfast is omelet with ketchups on it. I really enjoy a savvy omelet in the morning with a cup of black coffee.  Ham, sausage, mushroom, and cheese are must-haves for my omelet. I go to “Afternoon Delight” in Ann Arbor for my breakfast or brunch and I always order omelet. </p>
                              <p>My favorite Chinese style breakfast is a traditional street food in my hometown Wenzhou, and it’s called “米面”, aka rice noodles. The Wenzhou style rice noodles is different from the ones that we know from Vietnam or other Asian countries. The noodle is quite thick and goes well with pork soup, it’s perfect for a cold winter morning when you just wake up and is getting ready for a day’s work. Rice noodle is the street food that I miss the most when I’m in the United States. </p>

                            <p>Dim sum is one of my favorite breakfast. Dim sum is a style of Chinese cuisine (particularly Cantonese but also other varieties) prepared as small bite-sized portions of food served in small steamer baskets or on small plates.  </p>
                            <p>Dim sum dishes are usually served with tea, and together form a full tea brunch. Dim sum traditionally are served as fully cooked, ready-to-serve dishes. The best one I’ve ever had was at MingHin Cuisine in Chicago. </p>

                            <p>By far the greatest joy of growing up in New Jersey was the abundance and quality of diners. My favorite dish from my town's diner had to be the chocolate chip banana pancakes. The sweetness of the syrup, bittersweet melted chocolota, all topped with a banana to make it feel healthy.  </p>
                            <p>The simplicity of the dish makes it my favorite; I can easily cook this any morning (and/or late-night) I please. </p>
